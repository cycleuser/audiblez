# A GUI MOD based on Audiblez: Generate audiobooks from EPUB files using Kokoro's high-quality speech synthesis

### This fork use Pyside6 to create a GUI for Audiblez.

The original Audiblez can be installed with pip and run with a single command.

Audiblez generates `.m4b` audiobooks from regular `.epub` e-books, using Kokoro's high-quality speech synthesis.

[Kokoro v0.19](https://huggingface.co/hexgrad/Kokoro-82M) is a recently published text-to-speech model with just 82M params and very natural sounding output.
It's released under Apache licence and it was trained on < 100 hours of audio.
It currently supports American, British English, French, Korean, Japanese and Mandarin, and a bunch of very good voices.

#### On my 7945HX notebook **it takes about 2 seconds convert GETTYSBURG ADDRESS by Abraham Lincoln to wav**, which is about  290 words (or 1,595 characters).

## How to install and run

If you have Python 3 on your computer, you can install it with pip.
Be aware that it won't work with Python 3.13.
Then you also need to download a couple of additional files in the same folder, which are about ~360MB:

```bash
pip install audiblez
wget https://github.com/thewh1teagle/kokoro-onnx/releases/download/model-files/kokoro-v0_19.onnx
wget https://github.com/thewh1teagle/kokoro-onnx/releases/download/model-files/voices.json
```

Then, the original way using audiblez with cli to convert an epub file into an audiobook, just run:

```bash
audiblez book.epub -l en-gb -v af_sky
```

It will first create a bunch of `book_chapter_1.wav`, `book_chapter_2.wav`, etc. files in the same directory,
and at the end it will produce a `book.m4b` file with the whole book you can listen with VLC or any audiobook player.
It will only produce the `.m4b` file if you have `ffmpeg` installed on your machine.

## GUI version

The GUI version is a simple GUI that allows you to select the book, the language and the voice, and then it will convert the book into an audiobook.

```Bash
python gui.py # This will run the GUI version with epub showing
python app.py # This will run the GUI version without epub showing
```

This will only generate wav files, you can convert them to m4b with ffmpeg later if you want to.

## Supported Languages
Use `-l` option to specify the language, available language codes are:
ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ `en-us`, ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ `en-gb`, ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· `fr-fr`, ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ `ja`, ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡· `kr` and ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³ `cmn`.

### But in fact the languages supported by official Kokoro releases don't contain Chinese at the moment.


## Speed
By default the audio is generated using a normal speed, but you can make it up to twice slower or faster by specifying a speed argument between 0.5 to 2.0:

```bash
audiblez book.epub -l en-gb -v af_sky -s 1.5
```

## Supported Voices
Use `-v` option to specify the voice:
available voices are `af`, `af_bella`, `af_nicole`, `af_sarah`, `af_sky`, `am_adam`, `am_michael`, `bf_emma`, `bf_isabella`, `bm_george`, `bm_lewis`.
